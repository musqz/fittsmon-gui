.SH NAME
fittsmon-gui \- Graphical configuration tool for screen corner hotspots.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fittsmon-gui

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fittsmon-gui
is a graphical user interface for configuring screen corner hotspots. It allows users to map mouse events (clicks, wheel scrolling, mouse enter/leave) in screen corners and edges to shell commands.

The GUI automatically detects all connected monitors and provides an intuitive interface for per-monitor, per-zone, and per-event command configuration.

.SH CONFIGURATION
All configuration is stored in:
.RS
.B ~/.config/fittsmon/fittsmonrc

Configuration changes are automatically saved when commands are entered or modified.
